* Random T2 Revision notes....

What it does:
   Random T2 is an init that sits in your system, and watches for Twilight
II starting up. When T2 starts off, 45 seconds later, RandomT2 checks the
system. If the mouse's coord is <3 on either the x or y axis, RandomT2
fakes a keyhit to make Twilight II shuffle the modules. QuickResponse
must be turned off.

   This is an internal release for the Twilight II 2.0 beta testers only.
It is aslo designed to bug Jim into working some more. :)
