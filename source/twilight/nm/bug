    I got my upgrade in the mail.....Having had many problems with earlier versions, its great to have a nice stable version now....works like a charm.

    Found one minor bug....When in the Clock Module, "Digital", the hour character is trashed when the hour changes.....i.e: when it changes from 4:59 to 5:00, the 5 character will not be drawn correctly.  No crashes, and it keeps telling time OK.  Just not redrawing the Hour correctly. :)

Love Scanner Mode. :)
