That's probably Zak's code; Ishared an office with him for 6 weeks this summer, so although I have a lotof respect for his coding, sometimes he can make stupid mistakes... :)   Well, I don't quite have my IIGS hooked up to anything but 120 vAC, and mystereo, so the printing isn't a problem. :)   Any thoughts on my idea of hardwiring the branches in the interrupts?   As to the 6-sided things, well, I'll tell you my secret. It's not matricesin the least. With my algorithm, I have one pair on the Y axis. (The first pointis always just to the right of the positive y-axis). Therefore, it's pair isthe same thing, but on the negative-y axis.   That leaves us 4 points (they're symmetric, think about it), so what weneed to do is rotate the given (x,y) + 60 degrees clockwise. If you rememberyour formulas from geometry (sin(x+y)=blah...), you'll see that:NX=cos(30)*y+sin(30)*xNY=sin(30)*y-cos(30)*x   And since sin(30)=0.5, that's merely a lsr instruction. I have the hexequivalent of cos (30) ($DDB3-- I wrote a neat HP48 program that translatesnumbers <1 to hex equivalents... Want it?), and so that's merely a _Multiply.Once I have the first point, (everything's in dx & dy from the center), I cangenerate the other 4 by negating the deltas, and all. Just draw it out, it'sreally simple.   You mentioned a bit ago that you didn't get the C flame source that I sent.Is that so, or what?Nathan----------------------- Headers ------------------------From nathan@cco.caltech.edu Wed Jan  5 00:55:27 1994Received: from punisher.caltech.edu by mailgate.prod.aol.net with SMTP (1.37.109.4/16.2) id AA17756; Wed, 5 Jan 94 00:55:27 -0500Return-Path: <nathan@cco.caltech.edu>Received: from localhost by punisher.caltech.edu  (8.6.4/DEI:4.41) id VAA18904; Tue, 4 Jan 1994 21:55:28 -0800From: nathan@cco.caltech.edu (Nathan Mates)Date: Tue, 4 Jan 1994 21:55:28 -0800Message-Id: <199401050555.VAA18904@punisher.caltech.edu>To: afcdyajim@aol.comSubject: Re:  some notesAOL-Member: afcdyajim
