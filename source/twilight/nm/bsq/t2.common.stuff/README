Nathan Mates's Twlight II common asm routine documentation

    These are very sketchy docs, as I simply wrote the things for myself,
and was asked today to upload them. I hope to be getting the sample "Ball"
T2 module source in C or Pascal soon so that I can distribute a sample module's
source that isn's copyrighted. :)

   Anyways, this set of files should include the file e16.t2, which is a
modified version of what Jim sent me earlier. I commented out some stack
offsets that aren't useful anymore, as my code takes care of the stack and
all on entry.

[ Jim- Modify the e16.t2 file to your linking; you wrote 90% of it :) ]

   Also included are a set of files, asm, macros, and exec files designed
to let you build the set of common routines.

[ Jim- If you don't want the datactl stuff to get out (I don't have the
datactl dox in this archive anyways), just delete the references to the
datactl file in "go" and "makemacs" as well as the datactl file. ]

   To save the time used in recompiling these common routines every time, I
have come up with a slightly new system, which I call objLibraries. That is,
the compiled form resides in your Libraries folder (13: under orca), and
they are linked in at link time. To do this, you simply need to tell the
computer to do so. Assuming that you have a blanker assembled to the name
objfile (with orca making the extensions .root, .a, .b and so forth), simply
use the command

link 13:t2.comm objfile

   Of course, you can add the KEEP= directive, the -x flag (T2 blankers are so
small that expressing is a waste) as you like.

   The 'build libraries' exec "go" is included so that you can run it and
copies of the objLibraries are in the right place.

[Jim- Just send me the Ball sample source and I'll make up a full demo. It's
a little hard to explain everything without referring to some source ]
