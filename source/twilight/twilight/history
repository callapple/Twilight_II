** YOU MUST DELETE YOUR OLD TWILIGHT.SETUP FILE!  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!**

***YOUR FEEDBACK IS DESIRED ON THE FOLLOWING!!!!!!!***

= do you think it is OK for T2 v2.0 to REQUIRE a hard disk drive?  I'm very close to making it not run off floppies..  is this okay?
= do you think it is OK to call GetCursorAdr and SetCursor when the busyflag is non-zero?  right now the don't blank T2 cursor won't appear when the busyflag is non-zero, but I don't like that... should I changet it?

= Please test advanced options: new module path, and swap time.  There is a definite bug (I think.. I haven't had time to check.) in swap mode that I don't have time to track down before kfest, that causes it sometime not to swap (I think..)  But play around with it anyways.  SHR Corners and Password options are not yet implemented.  I think there might be another bug in swap mode, perhaps only when used with Moire, but that's just a guess...  Try it and tell me what you see..

= I am not finished optimizing the interrupt routines.  Right now, I no longer lose characters while communicating, but only IF QuickResponse is turned off.  And when QuickResponse is turned off, sometimes a lot of keypresses can be missed by Twilight II.  I will be fixing this after Kansas..

- busy flag should NOW be zero during a foreground blank.  make sure this doesn't cause any problems because it's somewhat of a hack!
- when Twilight.Setup has been deleted, the next time you open T2 the first module will be selected.  If no modules are toggled, T2 will automatically toggle fg fader when you close it.
- if more than one module is selected, blank now and about module and setup operate on the first selected module
- there might be a bug in universe causing it to trash memory. be on the lookout for it!

reminders for jim:

[= usuable without HD at all????????]
[= james's swap ideas.. worth it?]

- nonremovableT2 flag/fix random mode enabler -- work at all on floppy systems?
- when random mode cannot be used, only the first toggled module will be saved to disk
- interrupt hogging
- advanced options (on/off SHR corners, on/off Text corners, on/off mouse checking, T2 module directory path setting, and any others that you might recommend!!)
- scheduler hogging (in some rare cases)
- print shop/AOL blanking (possibly)

v1.2d4: 19 Jul 94

	* 30 Jun 94 - T2 once again flashes the menubar box by writing directly to screen memory.  This should stop it from showing up on printouts.
	* 30 Jun 94 - Caps Lock Lock now defaults to ON.
	* 30 Jun 94 - Control Heartbeat now runs every 4/60ths of a second, instead of every 2/60ths of a second before.  SHR and Text heartbeats (neither active simultaneously) still run every 30/60ths second.  adb_magic (QuickResponse) now is called every 52/60ths of a second instead of every 30/60ths second.
	* 30 Jun 94 - Temporarily (now it's permanent -- July 8) disabled Text mode corners (I don't think anybody ever used them anyways and they just contributed to overhead).  This may become permanent, or it may find a place on the upcoming "advanced options" setup page.
	* 1 Jul 94 - T2 now opens a new port in between modules in random mode.  Previously the same port was kept, causing problems (e.g. Headlines followed by PowerGrid caused PowerGrid's initial message to be printed in headline's last font.).  Also, I eliminated a call to SetPort our port after OpenPort, because TBR2 says that OpenPort automatically sets the current port to the opened port. [Nathan]
	* 1 Jul 94 - Right before BlankT2, T2 now keeps DECBUSY until the BUSYFLG = 0.  After BlankT2, T2 calls INCBUSY an appropriate amount of times to restore the busy flag to what it originally was.  I debated between this and simply saving BUSYFLG and STZ'ing it myself, without going thru DEC/INCBUSY.  By going thru DEC/INCBUSY, pending scheduler tasks will be called.  I figure this is OK because we are indirectly in a RunQ environment, which is a stable environment.  As far as I can tell, the BUSYFLG gets incremented by the toolbox runQ routines before calling our BlankRunQ, and then it gets incremented once more by the toolbox when the BlankRunQ makes a SendRequest call to Blank_Screen.  I should also note that d3 did not zero the busy flag as it claimed to do, because I didn't know SendRequest incremented the busy flag again.  So now it works.
	* 1-2 Jul 94 - Swap modules now implemented (albiet a bit crudely at this point..).  Swap time is currently hardcoded at 15 seconds.  You'll have to live with it until later.
	* 2 Jul 94 - Twilight.Setup is now reopened during UnloadSetupT2, as per Nathan's request.
	* 2 Jul 94 - T2 now updates the modification time/date (of the Twilight directory) stored in the header of Twilight.Data when it figures out that Twilight.data doesn't need rebuilding, but the time has changed since last time (like for instance if the finder has changed finder.data, while all the modules have remained the same, causing the mod time/date to change)
	* 2 Jul 94 - added error checking to the routines that review and create and update Twilight.Data..
	* 7-8 Jul 94 - made some more modifications to the heartbeats.. specifically, split the SHR heartbeat mouse routines away from the SHR heartbeat.  The mouse routines are called one 1/2 second, and the other routines, the next 1/2 second.  This should help eliminate overhead.  Also cleaned up a __LOT__ of code.. (ongoing process)  And fixed a bug where T2 was filling up the scheduler (a big OOPS!) in text mode.  Also in the processed fixed Michael's bug report where caps-lock could lock the cursor in the "don't blank" image..
	* 8 Jul 94 - cccp runQ now runs only every 5 seconds (versus 4)
	* 8 Jul 94 - new thermometer control window to keep the user happy while the Twilight.Data file is being rebuilt..
	* 8 Jul 94 - Twilight II print on main window is now always black
	* 8 Jul 94 - new Advanced Options setup screen integrated into T2
	* 9-10 Jul 94 - more work done on Advanced Options.  Password resources created and integrated into T2's rfork.
	* 19 Jul 94 - a couple touch-ups.  Released prematurely but because I want it out before Kansas..
	* ~2 Sep 94 - Fixed saving of swap mode time..
	* 5 Sep 94 - Swap Mode should hopefully now work again..
	* 5 Sep 94 - lzss can now exit if movePtr becomes true..

v1.2d3: Jan/Jun 94

	* 14 Jan 94 - T2 Stop icon is now positioned correctly w/ new layout.
	* Jan 94 - module list nathan bug (forgot to allocate enough list memory for Background and Foreground Faders.. oops) [Nathan]
	* 10 Jun 94 - LZSS nathan bug.  forgot to ever call GetRingMemory, so the ringbuffer was overwriting 4k of random memory, usually at $E12000.  Oops! [Nathan]
	* 10 Jun 94 - fixed jsl remove_patches (should have been jsr), and eliminated one call to cantOpen
	* 29 Jun 94 - at remove_patches, we now check to make sure that our message has been retrieved before blatently jumping to it.. (thus put back the above call to cantOpen)
	* 29 Jun 94 - fixed bug introduced when we allocated the right amount of memory for fg/bg faders in the list.. oops.
	* 29 Jun 94 - now, t2 checks the modification time/date on the twilight module directory with a cached time/date stored in twilight.data when it was built.  If the times match, t2 assumes twilight.data doesn't need to be rebuilt, saving a bunch of GetDirEntry calls for each module..  the only thing that now can be added is if T2 finds the times don't match, and then goes through and finds out that all the modules haven't changed, then T2 could go back and update the time in Twilight.Data to the new time of the directory.  right now, T2 doesn't, so it must always keep checking with GetDirEntry each subsequent time.  Make sense?  I hope so. :)  This also caused Twilight.Data and Twilight.Setup to be moved into the CDevs folder.  Also fixed several bugs introduced by all the above modifications.
	* 29 Jun 94 - busy flag should now be zero during a foreground blank.  make sure this doesn't cause any problems because it's somewhat of a hack! [Nathan]

______
v1.2d2: 9 Jan 94

	* 2-3 Jan 94 - T2 now uses Greg's revised Tool.Patch code.  In addition, it will refuse to remove itself if something has nonstandardly patched the toolbox after T2.  To do this, the RemoveToolPatches call had to be moved out of the removeT2 request and into the CDev.
	* 3-4 Jan 94 - NEW Twilight.DATA file for caching the module information.  Twilight II loads many eons faster now!  (I'll time it later so I can put some impressive fact like "Loads up to 800% faster" in a future ad for T2 1.2)
	* 4 Jan 94 - new "list.asm" source segment.  also a bug or two left over from switching to "toggle"ing modules squelched.
	* 5 Jan 94 - fixed silly bug where if nothing was toggled, you couldn't blank now [Eric, Nathan]
	* 5 Jan 94 - adjusted T2 error string rects so that they will fit in the new T2 window [James]
	* 5 Jan 94 - upon opening up T2 for the first time (after deleting twilight.setup), no module will be toggled, and the first module in the list will be selected.  If no module is toggled before T2 is closed, foreground fader will automatically be toggled and saved.
	* 7 Jan 94 - fixed bug in GetNextChecked that caused the "Error $0000 has occurred while loading blah module.  T2 will not purge itself." message.  Also fixed the bug that caused the error to be reported as Zero.
	* 7 Jan 94 - new icon control
	* 7 Jan 94 - background fader now handled properly (WHEW!!!!).  It can only be toggled on when nothing else is toggled, and while it is toggled on, nothing else can be toggled.


______
v1.2d1: 2 Jan 93

	* 30 Dec 93 - blinking box now defaults to OFF (more interrupt friendly, too)
	* 30 Dec 93 - blinking box should now no longer blink on printouts
	* 1 Jan 94 - list draw procedure now uses SetCharExtra on module names that won't fit in the module list ("America Held Hostage" fits better!)
	* 1 Jan 94 - setup module name popup now has a fixed size so "America Held Hostage" fits
	* 31 Dec 93 & 1 Jan 94 - new layout!
	* 1 Jan 94 - new toggle button will eventually serve to toggle modules for random mode
	* 2 Jan 94 - T2 now supports coolcursor, by installing a runQ to run every 4 seconds to ask cccp what the state of the cursor is (this runQ is ONLY installed on cccp systems!!) (Should it be more than 4 seconds or less?)
