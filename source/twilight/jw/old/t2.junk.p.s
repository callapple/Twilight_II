Jim,

Here's some stuff on d33... hope you haven't outdated it already.  ;-)  Some last minute thoughts I had and didn't put into the ShrinkIt archive...

A preference for P8 blanking would be nice.  When I'm in P8, sometimes, I don't want T2 to do screen blanking for me.  It'd be nice to turn it off just for P8.

Also, don't forget to request a real file type from DTS for the Twilight.Setup file.  :-)

Hope you enjoy the stuff I'm sending now...
