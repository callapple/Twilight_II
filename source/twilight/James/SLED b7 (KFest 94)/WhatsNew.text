That make a lot of things look a lot nicer.<so>Also, the control key "easter egg" has been improved.  You can now reverse it by hitting control again.<so>But what about some new commands?  Let's start with something simple like...<so><print>FRAME<wait><frame green><wait 60><frame white><wait 50><frame black><wait 40><frame blue><wait 30><frame yellow><wait 20><for 1>	<frame darkred><wait 10>	<frame red><wait 10>	<frame green><wait 10>	<frame white><wait 10>	<frame black><wait 10>	<frame blue><wait 10>	<frame yellow><wait 10><next><for 4>	<frame darkred><wait 2>	<frame red><wait 2>	<frame green><wait 2>	<frame white><wait 2>	<frame black><wait 2>	<frame blue><wait 2>	<frame yellow><wait 2><next><clear><wait><left>I said it was simple.

I call it "TimeUntil".  It can tell you things like "There are<TimeUntil 12/25/94> until Christmas."  More importently, the first session at Kansas Fest begins in <TimeUntil 07/21/94 9:00>.  I hope to see you there!!!<so>FYI, this script was written<TimeSince 07/10/94 13:36> ago.  So, when are <color yellow>YOU<color on> going to write a script for S.L.E.D.?!?!?!?<so><wait>This S.L.E.D. script has been brought to you by the letter C and the number 0x2A.<so>S.L.E.D. is a production of the James C.
