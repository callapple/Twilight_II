Here are four screen saver modules for Phantasm.
The first is a simple one, it just blanks out the screen to black.  No fancy animations or stuff like that....just a plain black screen.  If I get a chance I might go back and rewrite it so that it will fade to a given intensity set by the user.
The second one is a Swirl screen saver.  It kinda creates spirograph type patterns.  Its a bit fancier, but not by much.  If you have my first version, please kill it since it contained a bug.
The third is a Linear line drawing saver; makes for interesting results.
Still pretty simple.
The forth one is a bit more bizzare.... the end result is the thing looks like
a colorful worm.

As you can tell, I have no imagination!  I have three more modules in the works, which may or may not get finished.  All depends on if people want to see them or not.  If you have any ideas for screen savers drop me mail or if you have any comments/complaints also feel free to drop me mail.

Please try and keep the ideas original!  I don't need a ton of people asking for Fish or Flying Toasters! (that is if I do get people asking for more, since my first release, I only got one reply! ohh joy!)

Feel free to do what you wish with em!  Use 'em, kill 'em, spead 'em around if you wish.  I really don't care.
