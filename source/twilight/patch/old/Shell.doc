I wrote this in about 5 hours today, so there are most likely some lingering bugs.  If you find any, please send EMail to (America Online) JonahS or (GEnie) J.STICH1.  I've included everything you need to recompile the program.  In this archive you should have gotten:     Shell.doc (This file)     Shell.asm (The APW assembly source for the program)     Shell.equ (The Genesys created equates for the Assembly source)     Shell.r320.rez (The rez source for the 320 mode resource fork)     Shell.r640.rez (The rez source for the 640 mode resource fork)     Shell.macros (The macro file for the assembly source)     Shell320.sys16 (The 320 mode version of the shell)     Shell640.sys16 (The 640 mode version of the shell)To change the resource fork, you'll need either Rez or a resource editing tool (Genesys comes to mind....)To rebuild the program, you should do the following:compile shell.asmcompile shell.rxxx.rez keep=shell.rforklinkiigs shell.root shell.a -o shell.dforkduplicate -d shell.dfork shell.sys16duplicate -r shell.rfork shell.sys16filetype shell.sys16 s16That SHOULD do it. EMail me if you have problems, and I'll try to straighten you out.  Hope you like the program and find it to be of some use.  Enjoy!
