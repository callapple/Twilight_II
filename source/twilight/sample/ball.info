
Well, here it is, the first of the long awaited Twilight II sample
source code files!

This is a very simple module..  Preferably the "use sound" checkbox
should be a popup or something that allows the user to set the sound
volume.  This module could be elaborated on in many ways - feel free to
try it! :-)

Included here, part of Ball (C version), are 13 files:

ball.info - this information file
ball.rez - the resources for the ball module (Rez source code)
ball.cc - the ball module source (C source code)
config.cc - more ball module source (C source code)
makefile - a makefile to put the whole thing together
rSound.bin - the "boing" sound (a binary image of the rSound)
ball - a compiled version of the ball module (ready to run!)
ball.d - a compiled version of the ball module's data fork 
ball.r - a compiled version of the ball module's resource fork
t2.h - Twilight II specific C header information (C header file)
t2common.equ - Twilight II specific assembly header information (not used by ball, but here for your uses)
t2common.rez - Twilight II specific Rez header information (Rez header file)
blank.template - the resource fork of blank.template contains a copy of the Twilight II setup window, so you can layout your setup screen controls graphically with Genesys and then save them to Rez source and fine-tune them manually (NOTE: You cannot use Genesys exclusively to create a Twilight II module's resource fork, because Genesys cannot create the rT2ModuleFlags resource required, and Genesys will not properly set your control IDs to the sequential format T2 requires)

NOTE: Rez and Orca/C are currently required.

Version 1.0: July 19, 1993
Version 1.1: July 8, 1994

Also included currently in the Twilight II v1.1 Developer Kit, but
available separately, is the Twilight II Generation 2 Module Format
(G2MF) Reference.  This AWGS file documents every aspect of the module
format in detail.  You NEED THIS FILE too if you plan on writing 
Twilight II modules.  You can get it from the same place where you
got Ball!  If you can't find it, email us below.

Coming SOON:

 - Other language versions of the Ball module.
 - Better documentation of the Twilight II IPC requests that modules can use!
