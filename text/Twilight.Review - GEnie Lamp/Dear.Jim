Saint-Hyacinthe, le 27 mai 1993Dear Jim,Here is the review. If there are any thing you would like corrected, you MUST send the corrections directly to Bruce (Hangtime) the deadline for the next issue, I am reminding you is THIS saturday. I wrote the review in a little more than 3 and a half hour trying to give Bruce as much time as possible. I have covered the major topics in my usual manner.If you don't believe I was fair, please drop me a note.Please send list of any other programs you might have.Sincerely,Ronald A.
