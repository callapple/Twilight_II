_____notes:- if more than one module is selected, blank now and about module and setup operate on the first selected module- there might be a bug in universe causing it to trash memory. be on the lookout for it!_________________reminders for jim:- fix random mode enabler- when random mode cannot be used, only the first toggled module will be saved to disk- swap modules after X minutes- interrupts- advanced options (on/off SHR corners, on/off Text corners, on/off mouse checking, T2 module directory path setting, and any others that you might recommend!!)- partial pathnames- scheduler hogging (in some rare cases)- print shop/AOL blanking______v1.2d2: 9 Jan 94	* 2-3 Jan 94 - T2 now uses Greg's revised Tool.Patch code.  In addition, it will refuse to remove itself if something has nonstandardly patched the toolbox after T2.  To do this, the RemoveToolPatches call had to be moved out of the removeT2 request and into the CDev.	* 3-4 Jan 94 - NEW Twilight.DATA file for caching the module information.  Twilight II loads many eons faster now!  (I'll time it later so I can put some impressive fact like "Loads up to 800% faster" in a future ad for T2 1.2)	* 4 Jan 94 - new "list.asm" source segment.  also a bug or two left over from switching to "toggle"ing modules squelched.	* 5 Jan 94 - fixed silly bug where if nothing was toggled, you couldn't blank now [Eric, Nathan]	* 5 Jan 94 - adjusted T2 error string rects so that they will fit in the new T2 window [James]	* 5 Jan 94 - upon opening up T2 for the first time (after deleting twilight.setup), no module will be toggled, and the first module in the list will be selected.  If no module is toggled before T2 is closed, foreground fader will automatically be toggled and saved.	* 7 Jan 94 - fixed bug in GetNextChecked that caused the "Error $0000 has occurred while loading blah module.  T2 will not purge itself." message.  Also fixed the bug that caused the error to be reported as Zero.	* 7 Jan 94 - new icon control	* 7 Jan 94 - background fader now handled properly (WHEW!!!!).  It can only be toggled on when nothing else is toggled, and while it is toggled on, nothing else can be toggled.______v1.2d1: 2 Jan 93	* 30 Dec 93 - blinking box now defaults to OFF (more interrupt friendly, too)	* 30 Dec 93 - blinking box should now no longer blink on printouts	* 1 Jan 94 - list draw procedure now uses SetCharExtra on module names that won't fit in the module list ("America Held Hostage" fits better!)	* 1 Jan 94 - setup module name popup now has a fixed size so "America Held Hostage" fits	* 31 Dec 93 & 1 Jan 94 - new layout!	* 1 Jan 94 - new toggle button will eventually serve to toggle modules for random mode	* 2 Jan 94 - T2 now supports coolcursor, by installing a runQ to run every 4 seconds to ask cccp what the state of the cursor is (this runQ is ONLY installed on cccp systems!!) (Should it be more than 4 seconds or less?)
