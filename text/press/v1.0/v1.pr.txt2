<continued>Version 1.0 was originally released publicly about a month ago at the Apple Expo East.  We are currently working on v1.0.1, which is anticipated within another month.  The suggested retail price is $39.95.  Twilight II itself takes up about 125k of memory.  Users with 1.25mb might be able to just scrape by if they do not have many inits and DAs and system sounds, but we recommend 1.5mb of RAM or more for optimal performance.  On disk, Twilight II occupies anywhere from about 50k and upwards (depending on which modules you want to have installed.)  A minimum of two 3.5" floppy drives is required.  A hard drive is recommended.  System 6.0 or later is required.Twilight II is a complete rewrite of Twilight I, the premiere modular Apple IIgs screen saver.  The numerous problems and bugs in Twilight I are gone, and the two products should not be confused.Digital Creations was formed in 1992 to handle marketing and distribution of DYA (Digital Youth Alliance) products, Twilight II the first of which.  The company is committed to supporting the Apple IIgs throughout the 90's.For further information:Digital Creations55 Skyview DriveTrumbull, CT  06611-4033Attn: Jim MaricondoPhone: (203) 377-1121 (evenings best)America Online: "AFC DYAJim"Delphi: "DYAJIM"GEnie: "DYA"Internet: "afcdyajim@aol.com"All trademarks belong to their respective holders.
