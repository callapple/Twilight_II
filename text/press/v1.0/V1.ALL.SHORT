DYA is proud to announce Twilight II (tm), the revolutionary new screen saver control panel taking complete advantage of and designed exclusively for your Apple IIgs computer!Prevent costly phosphor burn in from ruining your valuable monitor when the same image is left on screen for too long a time!  Twilight II presents an elegant solution to this problem (similar to After Dark (tm) on the Macintosh) where you can select from a variety of dazzling full color animation and special effect modules to be executed when no user interaction has taken place for a specified amount of time.  Twilight II is a control panel for use with Apple's Control Panel desk accessory on System Disk 6.0 or later.  Twilight II takes full advantage of the new great features in the new System 6.0 and the marvelous capabilities of the Apple IIgs computer.  Over two years in the making and written in 100% assembly language for optimal speed and performance, Twilight II clearly leaves the current competition stopped in their tracks!Some of the effects included in the over thirty Twilight II effect modules include: 3-D fractal mountains, rotated and scaled 3-D wireframe animation, plasma cloud generation, dazzling color fireworks displays that rival all others, snow (which can fall on the desktop!), a "life" simulation, rain, a bouncing fading clock, scaled and rotated lined polygon shapes, a display of static, a trek through subterranean tunnels, a kaleidoscope, a display of moire effects, a module where YOU draw the animation with any GS paint program, all the old modules from Twilight I, and many more.  (Note: many but not all of these modules are present in v1.0; they all will be available in v1.0.1.)  Utilizing the "random mode" feature unique to Twilight II on the Apple IIgs, you can even select a different module to be run each time the screen is blanked!The stunning special effect Twilight II modules work with all GS/OS desktop based applications that follow Apple's guidelines.  In addition, Twilight II will also turn the entire screen black for text screen based programs, such as the GS/OS version of America Online, and ProDOS 8 programs like AppleWorks 3.0 and ProTerm 3.  If you have an AppleShare network, Twilight II is also fully multi-user network aware.  Finally, if you are a programmer, full documentation will soon be made available on how to write your own screen saver modules!  Future additional module packages are also being considered.  The possibilities are endless!Version 1.0 was originally released publicly about a month ago at the Apple Expo East.  We are currently working on v1.0.1, which is anticipated within another month.  The suggested retail price is $39.95.  Twilight II itself takes up about 125k of memory.  Users with 1.25mb might be able to just scrape by if they do not have many inits and DAs and system sounds, but we recommend 1.5mb of RAM or more for optimal performance.  On disk, Twilight II occupies anywhere from about 50k and upwards (depending on which modules you want to have installed.)  A minimum of two 3.5" floppy drives is required.  A hard drive is recommended.  System 6.0 or later is required.Twilight II is a complete rewrite of Twilight I, the premiere modular Apple IIgs screen saver.  The numerous problems and bugs in Twilight I are gone, and the two products should not be confused.For further information:DYA55 Skyview DriveTrumbull, CT  06611-4033Attn: Jim MaricondoPhone: 203 377-1121 (evenings best)America Online: "AFC DYAJim"Delphi:         "DYAJIM"GEnie:          "DYA"Internet:       "afcdyajim@aol.com"All trademarks belong to their respective holders.
