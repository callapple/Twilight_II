I am writing to you in regard to a few errors which recently have appeared in your magazine in regard to our screensaver for the Apple IIGS, Twilight II.  This letter would have been written much earlier, but we've been very busy completing version 1.1 of Twilight II.First, on page 37 of the January 1993 issue, it is incorrectly stated that Twilight II is shareware.  Twilight II is a commercial program published by DigiSoft Innovations with a retail price of $39.95.  This fact was plainly stated out in the press release provided to Senior Editor Paul Statt for that article, but apparently it was overlooked.Second, on page 14 of the April 1993 issue, Contributing Editor Joe Kohn provides the wrong name of our company.  For a very short time we originally were conceived as Digital Creations, but soon we found out we had picked an unoriginal name, so we became DigiSoft Innovations instead.  We tried our best to make this name switch known and also made this fact clear when we agreed to donate the two copies of Twilight II for use in the Bouncin' Ferno contest.  In communications with Mr. Kohn before publication, we first learned of this error, and we were assured that it would be fixed before the issue went to print.  We were thus surprised when we received the April issue with no correction made.Lastly, and totally unrelated, I personally feel bewilderment at the 1040Works screenshot on page 12 of the April issue.  At first I could not figure out what a Mac screenshot was doing in the Apple II "What's new" section.  Upon studying the picture closely however, I can make out a window entitled "1040.screen.textfile" which appears to be loaded into the Macintosh version of America Online, on a large (21"?) monitor with resulting text so small you must strain to read it.  This seems an incredibly ludicrous roundabout way to print a screenshot of an Apple II program!  Is there a reason I'm missing?  Maybe it would have made sense to do a screenshot of a different program instead?Sincerely,Jim MaricondoDigiSoft Innovations
